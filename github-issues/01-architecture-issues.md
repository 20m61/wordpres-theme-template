# Architecture-Related GitHub Issues

## Issue #1: Migrate from Procedural to OOP Architecture
**Title:** Refactor functions.php to Object-Oriented Architecture with Namespacing

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `architecture`, `high-priority`

**Assignee:** @copilot

**Description:**
Current `functions.php` file is bloated with procedural code. We need to migrate to a modern OOP architecture with proper PHP namespacing.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create namespace structure `KawaiiUltra\Theme`
- [ ] Extract functionality into logical classes:
  - [ ] `Core\Theme` - Main theme initialization
  - [ ] `Core\Assets` - Asset loading and management
  - [ ] `Core\Setup` - Theme setup and configuration
  - [ ] `Admin\Customizer` - Customizer settings
  - [ ] `Utils\Sanitization` - Data sanitization helpers
- [ ] Implement PSR-4 autoloading via Composer
- [ ] Update `functions.php` to bootstrap the OOP structure
- [ ] Add comprehensive PHPDoc comments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All procedural code removed from functions.php
- Each class has single responsibility
- No naming conflicts with other themes/plugins
- All functions properly namespaced
